This script uses a while loop to iterate 10 times, and each iteration it prints the string "Best School" to the console.
The variable count is initialized to 1, and the while loop continues to run as long as count is less than or equal to 10.
The count variable is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration using the count=$((count+1)) command.
The script starts with the line #!/bin/bash which is called shebang, it tells the system that this script is written in bash.
You can make the script executable by running chmod +x scriptname.sh and run it by typing ./scriptname.sh
