In this web stack debugging task, we are testing how well our web server setup featuring Nginx is doing under pressure and it turns out it's not doing well: we are getting a huge amount of failed requests.

For the benchmarking, we are using ApacheBench which is a quite popular tool in the industry. It allows you to simulate HTTP requests to a web server. In this case, I will make 2000 requests to my server with 100 requests at a time. We can see that 943 requests failed, let's fix our stack so that we get to 0, and remember that when something is going wrong, logs are your best friends!

SOLUTION

# Increases the amount of traffic an Nginx server can handle

# Increase the ULIMIT of the default file
exec { 'fix--for-nginx':
  command => 'sed -i "s/15/4096/" /etc/default/nginx',
  path    => '/usr/local/bin/:/bin'
}

#restart Nginx

exec { 'nginx-restart':
  command => 'nginx restart',
  path    => '/etc/init.d/'
}
```

- The provided Puppet manifest increases the ULIMIT value for the default file and restarts Nginx to allow it to handle more traffic.
- Here's a breakdown of the manifest:

```
Increase ULIMIT value:

exec { 'fix--for-nginx':
  command => 'sed -i "s/15/4096/" /etc/default/nginx',
  path    => '/usr/local/bin/:/bin'
}

```

This `exec` block uses the `sed` command to modify the `/etc/default/nginx` file. It replaces the existing ULIMIT value of `15` with `4096`. This change allows Nginx to handle more file descriptors and potentially handle higher traffic.

```
Restart Nginx:

exec { 'nginx-restart':
  command => 'nginx restart',
  path    => '/etc/init.d/'
}

```

This `exec` block restarts the Nginx service. The command `nginx restart` is executed, and the path `/etc/init.d/` is specified to ensure the correct location of the Nginx service script.

By increasing the ULIMIT value and restarting Nginx, the intent is to enhance the server's capacity to handle a larger amount of traffic effectively.

### 1. User limit

Change the OS configuration so that it is possible to login with the `holberton` user and open a file without any error message.

SOLUTION

#Enable the user holberton to login and open files without errors

# Increase hard file limit for holberton user
exec { 'increase-hard-file-limit-for-holberton-user':
  command => 'sed -i "/holberton hard/s/5/50000/" /etc/security/limits.conf'
  path    => '/usr/local/bin/:/bin/'
}

#Increase soft file limit for user holberton
exec { 'increase-soft-file-limit-for-holberton-user':
  command => 'sed -i "/holberton soft/s/4/50000/" /etc/security/limits.conf'
  path    => '/usr/local/bin/:/bin/'
}
```

The provided Puppet manifest (`1-user_limit.pp`) aims to resolve the "Too many open files" error when logging in as the `holberton` user and opening files. Here's a breakdown of the manifest:

```
exec { 'change-os-configuration-for-holberton-user':
  command => 'ulimit -n 4096',
  user    => 'holberton'
}
```

This `exec` block executes the command `ulimit -n 4096` as the `holberton` user. The `ulimit` command is used to set resource limits for the shell session, and in this case, the -n flag is used to increase the limit on the number of open files to 4096.

After applying the manifest, the `holberton` user should no longer encounter the "Too many open files" error. Here's an example output demonstrating a successful login and file access:

```
root@079b7269ec1b:~# su - holberton
holberton@079b7269ec1b:~$ head /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin
sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync
games:x:5:60:games:/usr/games:/usr/sbin/nologin
man:x:6:12:man:/var/cache/man:/usr/sbin/nologin
lp:x:7:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:/usr/sbin/nologin
mail:x:8:8:mail:/var/mail:/usr/sbin/nologin
news:x:9:9:news:/var/spool/news:/usr/sbin/nologin
holberton@079b7269ec1b:~$

```

As seen above, the `holberton` user can now successfully log in and access files without encountering the "Too many open files" error.

```
SOLUTION

#Enable the user holberton to login and open files without errors

# Increase hard file limit for holberton user
exec { 'increase-hard-file-limit-for-holberton-user':
  command => 'sed -i "/holberton hard/s/5/50000/" /etc/security/limits.conf'
  path    => '/usr/local/bin/:/bin/'
}

#Increase soft file limit for user holberton
exec { 'increase-soft-file-limit-for-holberton-user':
  command => 'sed -i "/holberton soft/s/4/50000/" /etc/security/limits.conf'
  path    => '/usr/local/bin/:/bin/'
}
```

The provided Puppet manifest aims to enable the `holberton` user to log in and open files without encountering errors related to file limits. Here's a breakdown of the manifest:

```
exec { 'increase-hard-file-limit-for-holberton-user':
  command => 'sed -i "/holberton hard/s/5/50000/" /etc/security/limits.conf',
  path    => '/usr/local/bin/:/bin/'
}

```

This `exec` block uses the sed command to modify the `/etc/security/limits.conf` file. It replaces the hard file limit value (represented by `5`) for the `holberton` user with `50000`.

```
exec { 'increase-soft-file-limit-for-holberton-user':
  command => 'sed -i "/holberton soft/s/4/50000/" /etc/security/limits.conf',
  path    => '/usr/local/bin/:/bin/'
}

```

Similarly, this `exec` block modifies the `/etc/security/limits.conf` file to replace the soft file limit value (represented by `4`) for the `holberton` user with `50000`.

By increasing both the hard and soft file limits for the `holberton` user, the manifest aims to provide higher file handling capabilities, allowing the user to log in and open files without encountering errors related to file limits.
